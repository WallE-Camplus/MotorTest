# MotorTest

Simple Arduino project to test 4 DC motors using a Raspberry Pi Pico and two TB6612FNG.
The project has been tested on a Raspberry Pi Pico using the MbedOS target included in Arduino IDE, however it should work with any Arduino by just correcting the pins.

## File information

This project uses a Motor class to control each motor.
The pins used are written in the `config.h` file.
